Connector for Midi63 are expensive and shape dependant of productor. Is there ways that people can craft at home with 3dPrint. 


I am sad because Midi 6.3 Pedal are good but they are expensive.
And if you want to do arduino project you need:
- to buy "expensive" connector 
- to buy shape that are dependant from a store to an other.

I would love to find a way for 6.3mm jack to be connected to arduino in low cost and world accessible ways in my project.
